# World Cup QATAR 2022 Prediction: Project Overview

This project aims to predict the results of the QATAR 2022 World Cup from the international matches held since the 90s, the qualifications of the teams in their last matches, and the potential of each team.

## Resources Used

* Python Version: 3.7
* Packages: Pandas, NumPy, Sklearn, Tensorflow, and Seaborn.

## Predictions

The Notebook [Predictions.ipynb] uses the inference datasets and the trained models to predict the World Cup matches and thus find the winner of the World Cup. It is essential to mention that to choose who is the home team in each World Cup match, use dataset [squad_stats.csv], which provides the potential of each team; therefore, the team with more significant potential will be the home team.
